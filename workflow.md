# ShowSync Development Workflow

## Overview
This workflow ensures that each feature is thoroughly tested and confirmed before moving to the next development phase. It emphasizes incremental development, continuous feedback, and maintainable code quality.

## Core Workflow Principles

1. **One Feature at a Time**: Complete each task fully before moving to the next
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
3. **Continuous Integration**: Every commit should be deployable
4. **Documentation as Code**: Update docs with every feature
5. **Stakeholder Validation**: Get confirmation before proceeding

```

#### Step 1.1: Task Planning (15 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Read task description from `tasks.md`
- [ ] Identify acceptance criteria
- [ ] Review any architectural decisions in `architecture.md`
- [ ] Create or update GitHub issue for the task
- [ ] Estimate time required

**Output:** Clear understanding of what needs to be built

#### Step 1.2: Environment Setup (10 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Pull latest code from main branch
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-{number}-{description}`
- [ ] Verify local environment is working
- [ ] Check that all tests pass: `./mvnw test`
- [ ] Start local services (database, Redis, external APIs)

**Output:** Clean development environment ready for implementation

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### Step 2.1: Test-First Development (30-60 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Write failing unit tests for the new functionality
- [ ] Write integration tests if needed
- [ ] Implement the minimum code to make tests pass
- [ ] Refactor code while keeping tests green
- [ ] Add error handling and edge cases

**Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Run unit tests
./mvnw test

# Run integration tests
./mvnw test -Dtest=**/*IntegrationTest

# Run specific test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=UserServiceTest

# Run with coverage
./mvnw test jacoco:report
```

**Output:** Working implementation with comprehensive tests

#### Step 2.2: Manual Testing (15-30 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Start the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
- [ ] Execute the specific test case from `tasks.md`
- [ ] Test happy path scenarios
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Document any issues found

**Testing Tools:**
- **API Testing**: Postman, curl, or HTTPie
- **Database**: pgAdmin, DBeaver, or psql
- **Logs**: Check application logs for errors
- **Monitoring**: Check health endpoints

**Example Test Session:**
```bash
# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"password123"}'

# Test protected endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/user/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}"
```

**Output:** Manually verified functionality works as expected

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance

#### Step 3.1: Code Quality Check (10 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Run code quality tools
- [ ] Check test coverage is adequate (>80%)
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper logging is in place
- [ ] Verify error handling

**Quality Commands:**
```bash
# Check test coverage
./mvnw jacoco:report
# Open target/site/jacoco/index.html

# Run static analysis (if configured)
./mvnw spotbugs:check
./mvnw checkstyle:check

# Run all quality checks
./mvnw verify
```

**Output:** Code meets quality standards

#### Step 3.2: Integration Verification (15 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Test feature in context of existing functionality
- [ ] Verify no regression in existing features
- [ ] Check database migrations work correctly
- [ ] Test API endpoints with frontend (if available)
- [ ] Verify real-time features work (if applicable)

**Integration Tests:**
```bash
# Run full integration test suite
./mvnw integration-test

# Test database migrations
./mvnw flyway:migrate
./mvnw flyway:info

# Test with test data
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=test
```

**Output:** Feature integrates well with existing system

### Phase 4: Documentation & Commit

#### Step 4.1: Documentation Update (10 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Update API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Add/update code comments
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Document any configuration changes
- [ ] Update architecture notes if applicable

**Documentation Checklist:**
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] New configuration properties documented
- [ ] Database schema changes documented
- [ ] Any breaking changes noted

**Output:** Complete documentation for the feature

#### Step 4.2: Commit & Push (5 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Stage changes: `git add .`
- [ ] Commit with clear message: `git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication system"`
- [ ] Push to feature branch: `git push origin feature/task-{number}-{description}`
- [ ] Create pull request with description and screenshots

**Commit Message Format:**
```
feat: brief description of the feature

- Detailed description of what was implemented
- Any important technical decisions
- Testing notes

Closes #issue-number
```

**Output:** Code committed and ready for review

### Phase 5: Validation & Deployment

#### Step 5.1: Stakeholder Review (Variable)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Demo the feature to stakeholders
- [ ] Walk through the test cases
- [ ] Collect feedback and requirements
- [ ] Document any requested changes
- [ ] Get approval to proceed or iterate

**Demo Script Template:**
1. **Context**: Briefly explain what was built
2. **Demo**: Show the feature working end-to-end
3. **Test Cases**: Execute the specific test from tasks.md
4. **Edge Cases**: Show error handling
5. **Questions**: Address any concerns

**Output:** Stakeholder approval or clear feedback for iteration

#### Step 5.2: Production Preparation (10 minutes)
**Actions:**
- [ ] Merge feature branch to main
- [ ] Tag release if needed
- [ ] Update environment configurations
- [ ] Run production deployment checklist
- [ ] Monitor application health after deployment

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Build production artifact
./mvnw clean package -Pprod

# Run in production mode locally
java -jar target/showsync-*.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod

# Deploy to staging/production
# (This would be your specific deployment process)
```

**Output:** Feature deployed and monitored
